<h1>CS2350: Client-side Web Development</h1>

<h2>HTML5</h2>
<p>HTML5, also known as Hypertext Markup Language 5, is a markup language that is used to structure and present content on the world wide web. The filename extensions it has are .html and .htm. With each new entry, more multimedia support as well as faster page load times and performance has been added. Html is essentially made to hold different components in a website.</p>

<h2>CSS3</h2>
<p>CSS3, also known as Cascading Style Sheet level 3, is responsible for adding style and fashion to a web page. It provides the developer several forms of customization for their website and goes hand in hand with HTML5. Css is more basic version of css3 which does not support a responsive design.</p>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>Javascript is a programming language used in most websites. With the creation of node.js, javascript boosted in popularity due to the opportunity of becoming an independent runtime system. It focuses on the overall functionality of the site and ties html and css3 together to provide overall practicality.</p>
