	<p>
		Hi there. I am Matthew Mendoza, a current student at Weber State University. I love computer science and tech,
		and plan to earn
		my bachelors degree in computer science. I adore playing my electric guitar, writing poetry, and also
		playing video games, <em>preferably ones that are challenging.</em><br>

	<h2>
		What classes I am currently taking
	</h2>
	<p>
		I am currently taking 4 classes this semester. Cs 2705 which is Network Fundamentals and Design. This class
		tackles Networking and different ways our electronics connect with one another. Another class I am currently
		taking is Math 1040 which tackles statistics, essentially breaking down graphs and analyzing data. The last one
		I'm taking apart from this class is guitar private instruction where I essentially just learn new techniques on
		guitar from a dedicated private instructor. <br><br>

		Learning outside of the classroom

	</h2>
	<p>
		I've had some pretty exciting experiences outside of the classroom; I've competed in science Olympiad
		competitions, recited poems in Spanish for dual language competitions, and even got some medals for it. I love
		to nerd out and spend time with my friends, as well as learn about the complicated topics of music theory. Apart
		from that, I absolutely love to read others poetry to learn how to improve my own.<br><br>
	</p>
	<h3>My Big Project</h3>
	<p>Starborne is a video game made in the Godot game engine using GDscript, a python-like language. Some friends and
		I came up with the idea for a competition that took place in March of 2023. The game takes place on a cryptic
		planet that is meant to be explored by a team of colonizers. Sadly, all but one of the members pass away due to
		crash landing on the planet thanks to its gravitational pull. You as the survivor are tasked with uncovering the
		secrets of Nyxis, the planet of darkness.
